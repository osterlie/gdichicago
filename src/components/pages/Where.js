            <p>If you are new to climbing, the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/RaleighRockClimbing/">Raleigh Rock Climbing Meetup</a> is a great place to start. They are a friendly group of climbers who organize regular outings to the local gym. Generally, you'll get a group discount on admission. You also get patient instructors who enjoy teaching new climbers.</p>
            <p>If you prefer a more structured learning experience, many gyms offer classes for beginners.</p>
